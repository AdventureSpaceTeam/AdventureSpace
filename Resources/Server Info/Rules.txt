[color=#a4885c]The[/color] [color=#ffd700]Golden[/color] [color=#a4885c]Rule.[/color] Admins can disregard any and all of these rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large. They will of course be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Don’t be a dick. We’re all here to have fun. Antagonists have leeway here since ruining the round is kind of their job, but try to keep it interesting if you’re antag.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Erotic Roleplay (ERP) is [color=#ff0000]not allowed under any circumstance[/color].

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Harassment of other players for OOC/meta reasons is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].
	- Annoying somebody in a round for IC/RP reasons is fine. Doing it consistently across multiple rounds for OOC reasons (“I don’t like this 		  player” AKA metagrudging) to the point where it becomes seriously problematic for the other player(s) is [color=#ff0000]not[/color].

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Real life hate speech/slurs are not allowed.
	- You are [color=#ff0000]NOT allowed[/color] to be racist against skin colors or start shouting the n-word, or similar IRL problems.
	- You [color=#00ff00]ARE allowed[/color] to be e.g. speciesist against in-game species (if we ever get any). Keep it interesting RP wise.
	- Slurs like lig*** that are closely tied to real life slurs are [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Offensive/bad character names put you at the mercy of administrators, from receiving brain damage to becoming valid to straight up getting banned on the spot depending on how bad they are.

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Knowingly performing activities that can slowdown or crash the server is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].
