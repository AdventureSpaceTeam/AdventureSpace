Some notes on gameplay. To talk in OOC, prefix your chat message with an [color=#a4885c]open bracket[/color] or [color=#a4885c]"/ooc"[/color]. Death is currently show as a black circle around the player. You can respawn via the respawn button in the sandbox menu. Instead of intents, we have [color=#ff0000]combat mode[/color]. Check controls above for its keybind. You can't attack anybody with it off, so no more hitting yourself with your own crowbar.
