  id: chem.Arithrazine
  name: arithrazine
  desc: A slightly unstable medication used for the most extreme any serious case of radiation poisoning.

  id: chem.Creatine
  name: creatine
  desc: A muscle-building drug that grants the user enormous strength, before their muscles seize and tear their own body to shreds. In practical terms, 1-25 units just causes toxin damage, and 26 units turns you into a hulk with all its associated benefits with the side effect of taking a little toxin damage over time. You'll remain as a hulk until it's all metabolized, at which point you'll take 200 brute damage and gib. With the correct administration, it can be the most potent drug there is, but even at the best of times it is best considered a double-edged sword.
